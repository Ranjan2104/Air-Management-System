# Air Management System
 Imagine an airport. What are the first things that come to mind? A cavernous terminal, information displays, long queues, baggage claim conveyors, arriving aircraft waiting to be fueled and catered for imminent departure. Airports have a tight flight schedule with its associated staff management, passenger processing, attention to minute detail, and much more. Airport automation speeds up the processes and improves the quality of service.  We have addressed best practices for modernizing airline operations and put our talents to work for Merlot Aero advance airline management. In this article we will take a detailed look at main airport operations and the ways integrated software solutions can facilitate them, as well as describe some integrated airport management suites from key vendors.  Our article consists of two major parts: a general overview of key airport operations, and the description of some of the most widely used solutions on the market. If you know the basics, just skip the first part and go straight to the second one.
